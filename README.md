# Stats220

This is my repo for **STATS 220** 

## A little about me:

* My name is *Aidan Whiteford* and I'm currently undertaking a degree in **Pharmacology**
* I am taking **STATS 220** because I want to expand my data analysis and management skills and also learn some coding
* I am interested in learning about how data is analysed and transformed into a presentable format that anyone can understand and the coding needed to be able to do these things
* I love watching movies and my top three movies are:
    1. Shawshack Redemption
    2. Mad Max Fury Road
    3. The Sixth Sense
* I also really enjoy video games and one that im playing at the moment is Monster Hunter Wilds. You can find out more about the game at [this link](https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-us/)

Here is a GIF that captures how I feel after having to hunt **13** Gore Magala's in monster hunter to get the materials I needed
